This is a running project,
some simple scripts to help build repetition and strengthing basic language learning skills.

Please message me for requests.

A rare resource used to build these tools are: Komoiboros Dusun-Kadazan Dictionary Winonsoi/by: MBDK (Mongulid Boros Dusun Kadazan) 

Hopefully more books like this can be digitalized.
