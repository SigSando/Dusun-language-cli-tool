#README#

This is a running project,
some simple scripts to help build repetition and strengthing basic language learning skills.

Please message me for requests.

A rare resource used to build these tools are: Komoiboros Dusun-Kadazan Dictionary Winonsoi/by: MBDK (Mongulid Boros Dusun Kadazan) 

Hopefully i can get a lot out out of different books and resources to preserve for future generations.

if the spelling or word for the number does not match t, the correct answer is shown.
